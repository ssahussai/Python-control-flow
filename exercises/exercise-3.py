# exercise-03 Calculate Dog Years

# Write the code that:
# 1. Prompts the user to enter a dog's age in human years like this:
#      Input a dog's age in human years: 
# 2. Calculates the equivalent dog years, where:
#      - The first two years count as 10 years each
#      - Any remaining years count as 7 years each
# 3. Prints the answer in the following format:
#      The dog's age in dog years is xx

# Hint:  Use the int() function to convert the string returned from input() into an integer

dog_years = int(input("Input a dog's age in human years:"))
if dog_years <= 2:
    print(f"The dog's age in dog years is {dog_years * 10}")
elif dog_years > 2: 
    print(f"The dog's age in dog years is {((dog_years - 2) * 7) + 20}")




#pseydocode:  
# prompt the user to enter "Input a dog's age in human years:"
# calculate the equivalent of dog years 
    # use if -- elif statement 
    # use int() to convert str to int
# print the answer of the calculation back to the ysers with 
# a prompt "The dog's age in dog years is xx"
